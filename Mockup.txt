The Basics
Clicking above a level makes the elevator move to it and pick up all the
people waiting.
Dropping people at the level with the indicator's color increases the time
that is left.
An unattended person will give up after a given time and decrease the number of
lives remaining.


The Conditions
The objective is to last as long as possible without letting the lives and time
run out.
The bars in the middle of the game show the indicators of the people in the
elevators, which has a max capacity of 3 people.
